#+TITLE: jsdoc.el

[[https://melpa.org/#/jsdoc][file:https://melpa.org/packages/jsdoc-badge.svg]]

This package provides an easy way to insert [[https://jsdoc.app/][JSDoc]] function comments and typedefs. It leverages a variety of techniques to generate documentation as much as possible without human interaction, including type inference and other similar approaches.

Please note that this package is only compatible with Emacs 29 or newer versions that support tree-sitter. If you are using Emacs 28 or an earlier version, please refer to the [[https://github.com/isamert/jsdoc.el/tree/emacs-28-and-below][emacs-28-and-below]] branch, which utilizes the [[https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter][tree-sitter]] package.

* Usage
To use this package, you can call the interactive command =jsdoc=. If your cursor is on a function definition, the command will insert a JSDoc-style function documentation comment. If your cursor is on a JavaScript object, the command will insert a JSDoc =@typedef= comment.

* Installation
jsdoc is available through [[https://melpa.org/#/jsdoc][MELPA]]. If you have it set up already, just do ~M-x package-install jsdoc~ and you are good to go. Otherwise please see [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA getting started]] page to learn how you can install packages through MELPA or see the following installation options.

Alternatively, you can use the ~straight~ or ~quelpa~ package managers in conjunction with ~use-package~.

To use ~quelpa~, add the following code to your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package jsdoc
    :ensure t
    :quelpa (jsdoc :fetcher github :repo "isamert/jsdoc.el"))
#+end_src

If you prefer ~straight~, use the following code instead:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package jsdoc
    :ensure t
    :straight (:host github :repo "isamert/jsdoc.el"))
#+end_src

- [[https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide][ananthakumaran/tide]] :: The command =tide-jsdoc-template= inserts a JSDoc template for your function. It's meant to be simple, no advanced stuff. It also requires ~tide-mode~ enabled (which runs ~tsserver~).
- [[https://github.com/mooz/js-doc][mooz/js-doc]] ::  Another package in the spirit of this one. Seems to have quite advanced stuff but didn't get it to work. Haven't got updated for a while.
